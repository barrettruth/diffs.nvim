INTRODUCTION                                                       *diffs.nvim*

diffs.nvim adds syntax highlighting to diff views. It overlays language-aware
highlights on top of default diff highlighting in vim-fugitive and Neovim's
built-in diff mode.

Features: ~
- Syntax highlighting in |:Git| summary diffs and commit detail views
- Syntax highlighting in |:Gdiffsplit| / |:Gvdiffsplit| side-by-side diffs
- Background-only diff colors for any `&diff` buffer (vimdiff, diffthis, etc.)
- Vim syntax fallback for languages without a treesitter parser
- Blended diff background colors that preserve syntax visibility
- Optional diff prefix (`+`/`-`/` `) concealment
- Gutter (line number) highlighting

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                              *diffs-requirements*

- Neovim 0.9.0+
- vim-fugitive (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) (optional, for unified
  diff syntax highlighting in |:Git| and commit views)
- Treesitter parsers for languages you want highlighted

Note: The diff mode feature (background-only colors for |:diffthis|, vimdiff,
etc.) works without vim-fugitive.

==============================================================================
SETUP                                                            *diffs-setup*

Using lazy.nvim: >lua
    {
      'barrettruth/diffs.nvim',
      dependencies = { 'tpope/vim-fugitive' },
    }
<
The plugin works automatically with no configuration required. For
customization, see |diffs-config|.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                   *diffs-config*

Configuration is done via `vim.g.diffs`. Set this before the plugin loads:
>lua
    vim.g.diffs = {
      debug = false,
      debounce_ms = 0,
      hide_prefix = false,
      highlights = {
        background = true,
        gutter = true,
        treesitter = {
          enabled = true,
          max_lines = 500,
        },
        vim = {
          enabled = false,
          max_lines = 200,
        },
      },
    }
<
                                                              *diffs.Config*
    Fields: ~
        {debug}              (boolean, default: false)
                             Enable debug logging to |:messages| with
                             `[diffs]` prefix.

        {debounce_ms}        (integer, default: 0)
                             Debounce delay in milliseconds for re-highlighting
                             after buffer changes. Lower values feel snappier
                             but use more CPU.

        {hide_prefix}        (boolean, default: false)
                             Hide diff prefixes (`+`/`-`/` `) using virtual
                             text overlay. Makes code appear without the
                             leading diff character. When `highlights.background`
                             is also enabled, the overlay inherits the line's
                             background color.

        {highlights}         (table, default: see below)
                             Controls which highlight features are enabled.
                             See |diffs.Highlights| for fields.

                                                          *diffs.Highlights*
    Highlights table fields: ~
        {background}         (boolean, default: true)
                             Apply background highlighting to `+`/`-` lines
                             using `DiffsAdd`/`DiffsDelete` groups (derived
                             from `DiffAdd`/`DiffDelete` backgrounds).

        {gutter}             (boolean, default: true)
                             Highlight line numbers with matching colors.
                             Only visible if line numbers are enabled.

        {treesitter}         (table, default: see below)
                             Treesitter highlighting options.
                             See |diffs.TreesitterConfig| for fields.

        {vim}                (table, default: see below)
                             Vim syntax highlighting options (experimental).
                             See |diffs.VimConfig| for fields.

                                                    *diffs.TreesitterConfig*
    Treesitter config fields: ~
        {enabled}            (boolean, default: true)
                             Apply treesitter syntax highlighting to code.

        {max_lines}          (integer, default: 500)
                             Skip treesitter highlighting for hunks larger than
                             this many lines. Prevents lag on massive diffs.

                                                          *diffs.VimConfig*
    Vim config fields: ~
        {enabled}            (boolean, default: false)
                             Use vim syntax highlighting as fallback when no
                             treesitter parser is available for a language.
                             Creates a scratch buffer, sets the filetype, and
                             queries |synID()| per character to extract
                             highlight groups. Slower than treesitter but
                             covers languages without a TS parser installed.

        {max_lines}          (integer, default: 200)
                             Skip vim syntax highlighting for hunks larger than
                             this many lines. Lower than the treesitter default
                             due to the per-character cost of |synID()|.

    Note: Header context (e.g., `@@ -10,3 +10,4 @@ func()`) is always
    highlighted with treesitter when a parser is available.

    Language detection uses Neovim's built-in |vim.filetype.match()| and
    |vim.treesitter.language.get_lang()|. To customize filetype detection
    or register treesitter parsers for custom filetypes, use
    |vim.filetype.add()| and |vim.treesitter.language.register()|.

API                                                                *diffs-api*

attach({bufnr})                                             *diffs.attach()*
    Manually attach highlighting to a buffer. Called automatically for
    fugitive buffers via the `FileType fugitive` autocmd.

    Parameters: ~
        {bufnr}  (integer, optional) Buffer number. Defaults to current buffer.

refresh({bufnr})                                           *diffs.refresh()*
    Manually refresh highlighting for a buffer. Useful after external changes
    or for debugging.

    Parameters: ~
        {bufnr}  (integer, optional) Buffer number. Defaults to current buffer.

==============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION                                        *diffs-implementation*

Summary / commit detail views: ~
1. `FileType fugitive` or `FileType git` (for `fugitive://` buffers)
   triggers |diffs.attach()|
2. The buffer is parsed to detect file headers (`M path/to/file`,
   `diff --git a/... b/...`) and hunk headers (`@@ -10,3 +10,4 @@`)
3. For each hunk:
   - Language is detected from the filename using |vim.filetype.match()|
   - Diff prefixes (`+`/`-`/` `) are stripped from code lines
   - Code is parsed with |vim.treesitter.get_string_parser()|
   - If no treesitter parser and `vim.enabled`: vim syntax fallback via
     scratch buffer and |synID()|
   - Background extmarks (`DiffsAdd`/`DiffsDelete`) at priority 198
   - `Normal` extmarks at priority 199 clear underlying diff foreground
   - Syntax highlights are applied as extmarks at priority 200
   - Conceal extmarks hide diff prefixes when `hide_prefix` is enabled
4. Re-highlighting occurs on `TextChanged` (debounced) and `Syntax` events

Diff mode views: ~
1. `OptionSet diff` detects when any window enters diff mode
2. All `&diff` windows in the tabpage receive a window-local 'winhighlight'
   override that remaps `DiffAdd`/`DiffDelete`/`DiffChange`/`DiffText` to
   background-only variants, allowing existing treesitter highlighting to
   show through the diff colors

==============================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS                                       *diffs-limitations*

Syntax Highlighting Flash ~
                                                             *diffs-flash*
When opening a fugitive buffer, there is an unavoidable visual "flash" where
the buffer briefly shows fugitive's default diff highlighting before
diffs.nvim applies treesitter highlights.

This occurs because diffs.nvim hooks into the `FileType fugitive` event,
which fires after vim-fugitive has already painted the buffer. Even with
`debounce_ms = 0`, the re-painting goes through Neovim's event loop.

To minimize the flash, use a low debounce value: >lua
    vim.g.diffs = {
      debounce_ms = 0,
    }
<

Conflicting Diff Plugins ~
                                                    *diffs-plugin-conflicts*
diffs.nvim may not interact well with other plugins that modify diff
highlighting or the sign column in diff views. Known plugins that may
conflict:

  - diffview.nvim (sindrets/diffview.nvim)
      Provides its own diff highlighting and conflict resolution UI.
      When using diffview.nvim for viewing diffs, you may want to disable
      diffs.nvim's diff mode attachment or use one plugin exclusively.

  - mini.diff (echasnovski/mini.diff)
      Visualizes buffer differences with its own highlighting system.
      May override or conflict with diffs.nvim's background highlighting.

  - gitsigns.nvim (lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)
      Generally compatible for sign column decorations, but both plugins
      modifying line highlights may produce unexpected results.

  - git-conflict.nvim (akinsho/git-conflict.nvim)
      Provides conflict marker highlighting that may overlap with
      diffs.nvim's highlighting in conflict scenarios.

If you experience visual conflicts, try disabling the conflicting plugin's
diff-related features.

==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHT GROUPS                                          *diffs-highlights*

diffs.nvim defines custom highlight groups. Fugitive unified diff groups use
`default = true`, so colorschemes can override them. Diff mode groups are
always derived from the corresponding `Diff*` groups.

Fugitive unified diff highlights: ~
                                                                  *DiffsAdd*
    DiffsAdd            Background for `+` lines. Derived by blending
                        `DiffAdd` background with `Normal` at 40% alpha.

                                                               *DiffsDelete*
    DiffsDelete         Background for `-` lines. Derived by blending
                        `DiffDelete` background with `Normal` at 40% alpha.

                                                                *DiffsAddNr*
    DiffsAddNr          Line number for `+` lines. Foreground from
                        `diffAdded`, background from `DiffsAdd`.

                                                             *DiffsDeleteNr*
    DiffsDeleteNr       Line number for `-` lines. Foreground from
                        `diffRemoved`, background from `DiffsDelete`.

Diff mode window highlights: ~
These are used for |winhighlight| remapping in `&diff` windows.

                                                             *DiffsDiffAdd*
    DiffsDiffAdd        Background-only. Derived from `DiffAdd` bg.
                        Treesitter provides foreground syntax highlighting.

                                                          *DiffsDiffDelete*
    DiffsDiffDelete     Foreground and background from `DiffDelete`.
                        Used for filler lines (`/////`) which have no real
                        code content to highlight.

                                                          *DiffsDiffChange*
    DiffsDiffChange     Background-only. Derived from `DiffChange` bg.
                        Treesitter provides foreground syntax highlighting.

                                                            *DiffsDiffText*
    DiffsDiffText       Background-only. Derived from `DiffText` bg.
                        Treesitter provides foreground syntax highlighting.

To customize these in your colorscheme: >lua
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'DiffsAdd', { bg = '#2e4a3a' })
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'DiffsDiffDelete', { link = 'DiffDelete' })
<
